# PathfindingBasics

This is a Unity project used in my series on pathfinding at youtube.com/user/TheHappieCat!

This includes implementations of BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, A* (Manhattan and Euclidean) where a cube navigates a maze of barriers and obstacles that slow it.

If you want the fill in the blanks BFS/DFS code, clone the first commit.
